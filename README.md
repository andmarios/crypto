# cryptographer (golang package) #


Cryptographer provides a simple way to encrypt or decrypt a message using NaCl secret key cryptography.
Optionally it can compress the data before encrypting them.

I use it for symmetric-key encryption schemes. Depending on your usage it may or may not be a safe option.
I do not claim any expertise in cryptography.

To use:

    import "github.com/andmarios/cryptographer"
